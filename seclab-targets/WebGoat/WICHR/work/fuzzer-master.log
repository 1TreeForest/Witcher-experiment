[1;91m[-] [0mHmm, looks like the target binary terminated before we could complete a
    handshake with the injected code. There are two probable explanations:

    - The current memory limit (8.00 GB) is too restrictive, causing an OOM
      fault in the dynamic linker. This can be fixed with the -m option. A
      simple way to confirm the diagnosis may be:

      ( ulimit -Sv $[8191 << 10]; /path/to/fuzzed_app )

      Tip: you can use http://jwilk.net/software/recidivm to quickly
      estimate the required amount of virtual memory for the binary.

    - Less likely, there is a horrible bug in the fuzzer. If other options
      fail, poke <lcamtuf@coredump.cx> for troubleshooting tips.
